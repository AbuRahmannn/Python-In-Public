# 🐍 Python In Public – My 100 Days of Python Journey

Welcome to my **#100DaysOfPython** journey — where I’m learning Python by doing, sharing, and building in public.  
This repository is a log of my daily progress, code, insights, and reflections as I dive deeper into the world of Python programming. 🌍✨

## 🚀 Why I'm Learning in Public

> "Learning in public isn’t about being perfect. It’s about being consistent, honest, and growing together." – swyx

- 🔁 To stay consistent and accountable
- 🧠 To reinforce my understanding through daily practice
- 📢 To share knowledge and connect with the community
- 📁 To build a living archive of my Python learning
- 🌱 To grow from feedback, mistakes, and repetition
